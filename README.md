# Feb-repo Project Title: Branching and Merging in Git



Objective: Learn how to create branches, make changes, merge them back into the main branch, and resolve conflicts in Git.

Instructions:

Create a New Repository:

Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or Git Bash.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.

Clone the repository you created in step 1.

Create and Switch to a New Branch:

Create a new branch with a meaningful name (e.g., "feature-branch") using the following commands:

bash

Copy code

git branch feature-branch

git checkout feature-branch

Make Changes:

Create a new file or edit an existing file within your project.

Add, commit, and push your changes to the "feature-branch."

Create a Pull Request (PR):

On the GitHub website, navigate to your repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab.

Click the "New Pull Request" button.

Select your "feature-branch" as the base and the main branch as the compare branch.

Create the pull request, providing a description of your changes.

Merge the PR:

Review and approve your own pull request (since you are the owner).

Merge the pull request into the main branch.

Introduce a Conflict:

Make a change to the same file in both the "feature-branch" and the main branch, causing a conflict.

Resolve the Conflict:

In your local repository, switch to the "feature-branch" and attempt to merge changes from the main branch.

Resolve the conflict in your code.

Commit the resolved changes and push them.

Update the PR:

Go back to your open pull request on GitHub, and you should see that it has conflicts.

Click the "Resolve conflicts" button and follow the prompts to confirm the merge.

Please complete the aforementioned project, make the repository public, and share the GitHub repository link.
